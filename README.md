Taking the Pre-Existing code and just changing it up a bit to allow for me to record hours of it looking cool and swarm like to use it as a background screen for my laptop.

My first time using Go and first time actually getting used to command line and github on linux, so this will definitely take me more time than normal.

# Physarum Transport Networks

![Example](https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/physarum/header.png)

This is a particle-based simulation inspired by the _Physarum polycephalum_
slime mold.

Details about the algorithm can be found on Sage Jenson's excellent webpage:

The algorithm is surprisingly simple given how complex its outputs appear.
That's the magic of generative algorithms!

## Usage

    go run cmd/physarum/main.go
